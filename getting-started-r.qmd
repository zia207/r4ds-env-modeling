# Getting Started with R {.unnumbered}


[R](https://www.r-project.org/)is a popular open-source programming language for statistical computing and graphics that can be used for DSM.  It was developed in 1980 based on the [S-language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)), and an open-source community regularly updates the software for a robust, programmable, portable, and open-source computing environment. We can use it to solve complex and sophisticated problems and "routine" analysis without restrictions on access or use.

Learning R can be a challenging but rewarding experience.Here are some steps to get started with learning R:

**Install R**: You can download R for free from the official R website (https://www.r-project.org/). Choose the version of R that is appropriate for your operating system.

**Install an IDE**: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) can help make coding in R easier. RStudio (https://rstudio.com/) is a popular and user-friendly IDE for R.

**Learn the basics**: Start by learning the basic syntax and data types in R. You can find many online tutorials and resources to help you get started. The official R documentation (https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html) is also a great resource.

**Practice**: Practice coding in R by working on small projects and exercises. Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/) and DataCamp (https://www.datacamp.com/) offer many R courses and projects to help you improve your skills.

**Join the R community**: Joining the R community can help you learn from other R users and get answers to your questions. You can find R user groups in many cities, and there are also many online communities such as the RStudio Community (https://community.rstudio.com/).
